The project is a refreshable Braille Display that provides a cost effective alternative to bulky Braille textbooks making it more accessible to visually impaired individuals. It consists of a microcomputer, 3D printed chassis and commodity and low-power motors that together form an 8-grid Braille display. Existing displays provide similar functionality, but cost between $3000 and $15000 dollars making them inaccessible to those who require them. Our project is a proof of concept showing that we can provide similar functionality for a fraction of the cost. This project can easily be expanded on to provide more functionality, and we have even included a LED grid to make it easier to see the Braille pattern.
